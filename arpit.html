<h1>you are the one in this world<br /> </h1>
<h2>my friend is you<br /></h2>
<p>
    Friendship is always pure and like a bundle of joy which only needs more and more nourishment to grow. Never ignore true friends or take them for granted. We may come across various people at different phases of our life. Many may pretend to be our friends
    but never go by outward glitter.
</p>
<p>
    I am proud of my friend and his friendship. Every day we spend our spare time together, we talk a lot and play various games together. I love my friend very much and I pray to God to keep him and his family safe and happy. This is all about my best friend.<br

    Friendship is one of the treasures that anyone can possess. God gave us the right to choose friends because they will be with us forever. Our parents and siblings are loving us as they are our own blood. But a friend is someone, who is initially a stranger.
    Then they take their place in our life above all the other relations. Friendship is nothing but true and pure love without expectations in return.<br />
